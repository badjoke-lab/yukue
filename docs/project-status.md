神社のゆくえ    #A33A32
寺院のゆくえ    #684B78
弔いのゆくえ    #486457
```

## Development governance

Implementation is repository-reference-driven.

Before work:

```text
root AGENTS.md
→ nearest nested AGENTS.md
→ docs/project-status.md
→ docs/development-schedule.md
→ governing specifications
```

Schedule layers:

```text
roadmap.md
= long-range phases and gates

development-schedule.md
= stable work-package sequence

project-status.md
= current position and next gate
```

## Current work

```text
B3 — UI review corrections and accessibility baseline
```

Review scope:

- Home H1 desktop and mobile visual behavior,
- Detail C desktop and mobile visual behavior,
- keyboard navigation baseline,
- visible focus states,
- semantic heading order,
- table headers and captions,
- sufficient contrast,
- route-based Place presentation,
- zero-image completeness,
- responsive overflow and reading order.

B3 should remain bounded to review findings from the static Home and Detail surfaces. It should not add schema, canonical data, browse/search implementation, or deferred features.

## Next stage

After B3:

```text
Stage C — Data Core
C1 — Common schemas
```

Then proceed through the remaining work packages in `development-schedule.md`.

## Not yet committed to MVP
