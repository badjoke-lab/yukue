```

## Development governance

Implementation is repository-reference-driven.

Before work:

```text
root AGENTS.md
→ nearest nested AGENTS.md
→ docs/project-status.md
→ docs/development-schedule.md
→ governing specifications
```

Schedule layers:

```text
roadmap.md
= long-range phases and gates

development-schedule.md
= stable work-package sequence

project-status.md
= current position and next gate
```

## Current work

```text
C3 — Cross-record validation
```

Target validation:

- ID uniqueness,
- record reference integrity,
- Relation endpoint integrity,
- Evidence target integrity,
- Place reference integrity,
- Current State derivation checks,
- Image primary uniqueness,
- image rights gate,
- Public Projection safety checks.

C3 must test both valid and intentionally invalid record sets and must not auto-publish or silently repair invalid data.

## Next stage

After C3:

```text
Stage D — Sample Canonical Data and Projection
D1 — Representative sample canonical data
```

Then proceed through the remaining work packages in `development-schedule.md`.

## Not yet committed to MVP

- Compare,
- dynamic API,
- MCP,
- paid API,
- x402 billing,
