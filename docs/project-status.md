寺院のゆくえ    #684B78

```

## Development governance

Implementation is repository-reference-driven.

Before work:

```text
root AGENTS.md
→ nearest nested AGENTS.md
→ docs/project-status.md
→ docs/development-schedule.md
→ governing specifications
```

Schedule layers:

```text
roadmap.md
= long-range phases and gates

development-schedule.md
= stable work-package sequence

project-status.md
= current position and next gate
```

## Current work

```text
C2 — Matsuri schema extensions and vocabularies
```

Target scope:

- Festival profile extension,
- Folk Performance profile extension,
- Tradition Unit extension,
- Organization extension,
- Shrine seed and Temple seed boundaries,
- Festival State vocabulary,
- Folk Performance State vocabulary,
- Matsuri Change Event vocabulary,
- Matsuri Occurrence type vocabulary,
- Matsuri Relation vocabulary.

C2 must not reintroduce `revived` as a standard Current State or `active_modified` as a State. A cancelled Occurrence must remain separate from Entity State.

## Next gate

After C2:

```text
C3 — Cross-record validation
```

Then proceed to representative sample canonical data and the Public Projection pipeline according to `development-schedule.md`.

## Not yet committed to MVP

- Compare,
- dynamic API,

- x402 billing,
- D1 canonical database,
- real-time ingestion.
