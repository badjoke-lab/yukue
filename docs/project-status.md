## Current UI direction

```text
white background
black / gray neutral system
one Mincho family system
thin rules
controlled whitespace
minimal card chrome
minimal shadows
site-specific accent color
```

Palette:

```text
祭のゆくえ      #284B63
神社のゆくえ    #A33A32
寺院のゆくえ    #684B78
弔いのゆくえ    #486457
```

## Development governance

Implementation is repository-reference-driven.

Before work:

```text
root AGENTS.md
→ nearest nested AGENTS.md
→ docs/project-status.md
→ docs/development-schedule.md
→ governing specifications
```

Schedule layers:

```text
roadmap.md
= long-range phases and gates

development-schedule.md
= stable work-package sequence

project-status.md
= current position and next gate
```

## Current work

```text
B1 — Matsuri Home H1 static implementation
```

Target structure:

```text
Hero + Search
Current Observation Snapshot
Recent Changes
Recent Occurrences
Explore
Methodology / Evidence
Data Access
```

B1 uses fixture data and the accepted shared UI foundation. It must preserve the white background, Mincho-only typography direction, restrained indigo accent, no placeholder images, and the accepted Home H1 section order.

## Next gates

After B1:

```text
B2 — Festival Detail C static implementation
B3 — UI review corrections and accessibility baseline
```

Then proceed to Data Core, sample canonical data, Public Projection, browse/search, and the machine-readable baseline according to `development-schedule.md`.
